No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 40-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.
>>>>>>> develop-sw

We don't need junky 30K async libs. Really.

For browsers and node.js.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* `npm install async-each` if you’re using node.js.

## Usage

* `each(array, iterator, callback);` — `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
=======
## Usage

`npm install async-each` if you're using NPM.

For browsers, just include async-each before your scripts and use global variable `asyncEach`

* `each(array, iterator, callback)` — `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
>>>>>>> develop-sw
* `iterator(item, next)` receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments.
* `callback(error, transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result `Array`.

```javascript
var each = require('async-each');
each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log('Contents for a, b and c:', contents);
});

<<<<<<< HEAD
// Alternatively in browser:
asyncEach(list, fn, callback);
=======
asyncEach(list, fn, callback); // use global var in browser
>>>>>>> develop-sw
```
