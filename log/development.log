Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-transform-private-property-in-object since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-transform-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-transform-class-properties, @babel/plugin-transform-private-methods and @babel/plugin-transform-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-transform-private-property-in-object", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

If you already set the same 'loose' mode for these plugins in your config, it's possible that they are enabled multiple times with different options.
You can re-run Babel with the BABEL_SHOW_CONFIG_FOR environment variable to show the loaded configuration:
	npx cross-env BABEL_SHOW_CONFIG_FOR=/workspace/you/app/javascript/packs/application.js <your build command>
See https://babeljs.io/docs/configuration#print-effective-configs for more info.
